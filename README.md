# Welcome to the a.js github
## A developper-first JavaScript Flexwork.
a.js aims to be a flexwork rather than a framework or a library. You can read the [Flexwork manifesto here](TheFlexworkManifesto.md)

a.js is a lightweight and versatile JavaScript Flexwork/library designed for building reactive and dynamic web components. It extends the power of native web components by introducing custom tags (`<a-script>`, `<a-closure>`, and `<a-tagDef>`) that simplify complex operations such as state management, reactivity, and scoped behavior. These custom tags integrate seamlessly with modern JavaScript, allowing developers to create dynamic user interfaces with ease.

## Key Highlights
- Enhanced web components for rapid UI development.
- Reactive variables managed through JavaScript proxies.
- Modular and reusable code through `<a-tagDef>`.
- Allow the redefine web components already declared with **a.js** as opposite to vanilla custom elements.
- Seamless integration with HTML and JavaScript ecosystems.
- **a.js** is licensed under [MIT license](LICENSE)
- No parser/parser library needed. **a.js** uses the browser engine to parse its tags.

## Getting started
Download the [a.js source](main/a.js), set a `<script src="path/to/a.js"></script>` in the `<head></head>` of your HTML document, and you are ready to go. All you need is a browser, you don't even need to setup a web server at all.
Of course, you can also use a.js on your live web site.

Visit the [a.js web site](https://www.a-js.org/featuresindex.html) or read the [documentation here](documentation.md) to learn more.

You can also directly check the [online examples](https://www.a-js.org/examplesindex.html) and download their code to experiment with them.
